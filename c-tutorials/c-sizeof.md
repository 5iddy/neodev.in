### Using sizeof Operator to get the sizes of various datatypes
```c
printf("sizeof(int) = %lu\n", sizeof(int)); // sizeof(int) = 4
```

```c
printf("sizeof(float) = %lu\n", sizeof(float)); // sizeof(float) = 4
```

```c
printf("sizeof(char) = %lu\n", sizeof(char)); // sizeof(char) = 1
```

```c
printf("sizeof(double) = %lu\n", sizeof(double)); // sizeof(double) = 8
```

```c
printf("sizeof(long int) = %lu\n", sizeof(long int)); // sizeof(long int) = 8
```

```c
printf("sizeof(long long int) = %lu\n", sizeof(long long int)); // sizeof(long long int) = 8
```

```c
printf("sizeof(long double) = %lu\n", sizeof(long double)); // sizeof(long double) = 16 
```
