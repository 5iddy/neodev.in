Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

```javascript
/_ Some pointless Javascript _/;
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

---

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags

---

```javascript
/_ Some pointless Javascript _/;
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

---

Finally, horizontal lines
