# Neodev.in is an open source tutorial website mainly focussed on Rust, C, Python and Linux.

Source Code is hosted on [my github repo](https://github.com/5iddy/neodev.in). Anyone can make pull requests and update the tutorials when needed. This website will be Free, Open Source and AD free. There are is no cookie policy because this is a static website hosted using Github Pages.

## The Rationale

When I look for tutorials, I often find websites that ask too many things like registering, accepting cookie policies and even disabling my adblock. But what is more annonying is that the information they provide is often outdated, incomplete and insecure.

A lot of these websites are maintained by people, IMO, aren't experts in these fields. They are mostly clones of each other with no new information but only what the other website seem to provide. It is quite common for blog website to analyze the top posts and copy all the information that they provide, a "technique" known in the business as SEO. 

The problem with SEO is that it discourages websites to link sources that make users leave their websites to maintain the on-page time. Its a major problem for the devolopers because having relevant reference sections linked in the tutorial is quite helpful for the devs.

Since the website is run by a for profit organisation, its not easy to update tutorials when things are updated. And so, this website is born.
